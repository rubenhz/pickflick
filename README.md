# PickFlick

## Description

PickFlick is a web application that gives user high-quality movie recommendations in a chat-like interface.

If you want to watch "action movies in space with a focus on politics," or if you just don't know what's the title of that one movie where they steal the Declaration of Independece (National Treasure), PickFlick is there to help.

PickFlick uses the powerful NLP (Natural Language Processing) models from OpenAI, and a carefully crafted prompt, to clearly understad what the user is looking for and give an appropiate list of recommedations.
